# Technical challenge

Design and build the Company Submission page for intern.camp.
We want to have a form for receiving information from the companies that want to join intern.camp.
The main goal of this step is to validate if the company meets the requirements.
The Company Submission page would substitute the contact button [here](https://intern.camp/app/for_companies).

## Required information
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Website
- Number of employees
- Mentors
- What interns would learn with your company

## Process
- Find out more about the project: https://intern.camp/app
- Research similar solutions
- Design a wireframe
- Build a prototype using HTML and CSS

You should create your own github repository, upload your work there and share it with us.
At the end, weâ€™ll meet to discuss your process, results and decisions. 

Good luck
